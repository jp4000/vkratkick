(Somewhat rewrited this script, tho the main structure remained still.)

Rat kick - script that will kick leaving and returning rats in your chat! (and logs it too.)

How to use:
  0. Install python.
  1. pip install vk_api
  2. Create folder for it, because it will probably spam you with log files.
  3. Change /login, password = "LOGINHERE", "PASSWORDHERE"/ in "ratkick.py" to yours.
  4. Run the ratkick.py(or crashhandler.py), define chat id(open the chat, and look at the number after "im?sel=c"), make sure that you're administrator of that chat too!
  5. Done.

Known bugs:
  1. It doesnt log non-cyrillic/non-latin characters. (because logging module is being a full retard)
  2. It can crash without a reason, but you can open crash handler to keep the script running!
